My name is Barry Bradshaw and I am the founder of Cross Technology.<br>

      <br>

I graduated Summa Cum Laude from DeVry in 1997 and started my IT career
with National Engineering Technology as a software engineer. NET is a
firm that specializes in Intelligent Transportation Systems. While with
NET I worked with many clients including the Minnesota Department of
Transportation, Illinois Department of Transportation, and the Port
Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

In 1999 I went to work for Distribution 2000, Inc., a third-party
logistics provider based in Bolingbrook, IL as their Information
Systems Manager. During my employment with Distribution 2000 I rewrote
and enhanced a major portion of their WMS system. I replaced the RF
system and rewrote the wireless client programs used by the system. I
also migrated the backend database for the WMS from Oracle to MySQL.<br>

      <br>

In 2007 I decided to step out on my own and as a result formed Cross
Technology.<br>

      <br>

      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>

My mission through Cross Technology is to glorify God by serving others
using the gifts that our heavenly Father has blessed me with. I will
service my clientele with an ethical standard second to none.<br>

      <br>

By doing my best to model the servant nature of my Savior I hope to
draw those around me close to the Lord where they can begin their own
personal relationships with Him.<br>

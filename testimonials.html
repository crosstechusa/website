      </span><span style="font-style: italic;">&ldquo;In
nearly
every environment today integration of technology is a prerequisite for
doing business. Maintaining full time resources internally to
accomplish this end can be cost prohibitive and impractical for the
small business; however, a solution is required nonetheless.
Outsourcing professional, competent and trusted assistance is a key
element to achieving success with this ongoing requirement. We have
found Barry to be an incredibly resourceful, knowledgeable and capable
individual. He delivers quality of the highest level in every aspect of
his IT contributions at D2000. We have been thoroughly satisfied with
his past efforts and plan to continue to tap his talents from time to
time as he is needed in the future. We highly recommend him to assist
you with your needs as well. His high moral character is matched only
by his remarkably extensive abilities and we believe he is always eager
to put his technical talents and know how to work.&rdquo;</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

has been a tremendous blessing to us. Before we contracted with Barry,
our computer
system was always giving us problems. Barry&rsquo;s insight into
systems paired with
his ability to recommend more economical and efficient solutions have
resulted in a computer network
that supports us, rather than frustrates us. I don&rsquo;t know
where we would be without
Barry as our consultant.&rdquo;<br>

has been a lifesaver for the preschool and for me personally over the
past five years. He has repaired the computers in the preschool office

systems operate more effectively because of his expertise. Barry has
been a teacher on many occasions who has showed us how to accomplish
our work more efficiently and professionally. He often helps us to
resolve a problem over-the-phone or through email. Consequently we are
